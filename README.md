# Welcome to the OpenCon HQ

OpenCon is a conference and community dedicated to advancing open research and education. In an effort to walk the talk, while increasing our effectiveness, transparency and openness we're changing our organizing processes to be "open-by-default".

On this repository you'll find the discussions we're having, what we're planning, what we're making and more.

## State of the repo

We're just getting this off the ground, best to hit watch the repo in the top right for notifications about when there is a bit more going on here.

# Using Github

Github was designed for coders to store their projects, but that's not what we're going to use it primarily for. Here, we'll use Github to replace internal email lists, gaant charts, todo lists, with more open practices.
