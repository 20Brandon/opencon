#Â Welcome to the OpenCon HQ

OpenCon is a conference and community dedicated to advancing open research and education. In an effort to walk the talk, while increasing our effectiveness, transparency and openness we're changing our organizing processes to be "open-by-default".

On this website you'll find the discussions we're having, what we're planning on doing, what we're making and more.

## State of the repo
