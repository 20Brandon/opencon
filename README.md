# Welcome to the OpenCon HQ

OpenCon is a conference and community dedicated to advancing open research and education. In an effort to walk the talk, while increasing our effectiveness, transparency and openness we're changing our organizing processes to be "open-by-default".

## What you can find here

On this repository you'll find the discussions we're having, what we're planning, what we're making and more.

# Using Github

Github was designed for coders to store their projects, but that's not what we're going to use it primarily for. Here, we'll use Github to replace internal email lists, gaant charts, todo lists, with more open practices.

# How to use this repository

If you're worried about using Github, we'll be including some guides soon. However, this section speaks more to the nuance of what different parts of the system will mean to use.

## Getting notified

There is a good chance you don't need to see everything that happens here as it happens.

![soeasy](http://g.recordit.co/Bo2gHzV96q.gif)

If Gifs aren't your thing...
> Up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center

For most people, the right setting is "watch". You can adjust your email notification settings on any page.

## Issues

Issues are where we host discussions about OpenCon. They're easy to [find above](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon/issues).

You can respond to an issue from your email client. When you get a notification, just hit reply - no need to use the site.

### When to start an issue

We're trying to be open by default, and use this to centre all to-do's & discussion. So, the answer is always, except:
* when it concerns fundraising, personnel (or personal) information, or other highly sensitive issues.
* when it's a todo that you can complete without anyone else's input (to track it, a "- [ ] " on an existing issue might make more sense).

If you're unsure, ask.  

* You can start an issue via email by sending your message to cloo+sparcopen/opencon@cottagelabs.com. The subject is your issue title, the email body is the issue comment.

### When to close an issue

When something is "done". This will depend on the issue at hand. A good practice is to, early on, define what "done" means.

Anyone can, and should, close an issue.

Closing an issue is a reversible process. If you think something needs more discussion or something was missed - reopen.

### Including others

By default, only a small fraction of the people included in a repository will be included. To reach out to more you can:
* "@" them directly by name
* "@" them by team name:
 * @sparcopen/oc-opencon
 * @sparcopen/staff-opencon

NOTE: Many OC members will not see messages by default.

### Assigning

Assigning is used to help people understand who can take action on an issue and who's responsible.

### Labels

Labels add meta-data and enable easy sorting of issues.

### Milestones

Milestones make issues / to-do's timebound.

## Projects

For now, we're not using projects. However, they could be used to sort our issues by "type", but this can also be done by labels :).

## Files / Code

For now, we're not going to use Github primarily to store files. Instead, we're going to stick to our normal Google Doc's ways, and simply linkout to our drive & important files.

# Other OpenCon repositories

We have a couple of other repositories for specific OpenCon projects / datasets. You can find them [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/).
