# New to Github?

## Start a discussion on Github
Do you see an issue in the report but would rather have us write the copy for it? Do you have a general concern that you'd like to raise publicly for discussion before we add it to the report? We encourage you to [**post a new Github Issue**](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/issues/new). How to do this:
1. Make sure you have a Github account, and are logged in. They're free and need very little information to make!
2. Click on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/issues).
3. Post your comment or feedback as an Issue by clicking "New Issue" in the upper right hand corner.

We encourage the community to contribute their feedback to [issues that have been raised by other community members](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/issues/new), as well!
