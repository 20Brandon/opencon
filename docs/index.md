# Welcome to the OpenCon HQ

OpenCon is a conference and community dedicated to advancing open research and education. In an effort to walk the talk, while increasing our effectiveness, transparency and openness we're changing our organizing processes to be "open-by-default".

## What you can find here

On this repository you'll find the discussions we're having, what we're planning, what we're making and more.
